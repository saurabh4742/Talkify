# Talkify Frontend

**Talkify** is a real-time auto-matching video and chat application, similar in concept to Omegle, but designed with advanced safety and abuse prevention features to protect users ‚Äî especially children ‚Äî from vocal and written abuse.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Talkify connects users randomly for real-time conversations via video and chat with a seamless "Next" option to move on to another match instantly. Unlike other anonymous chat apps, Talkify integrates **real-time detection of vocal and written abuse** to provide a safer environment for all users, preventing harassment and inappropriate content.

Key highlights:

- Auto-matching of users in real time, with easy ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to switch partners
- Real-time voice abuse detection during video calls (using LiveKit integration)
- Written chat abuse detection with instant filtering and warnings
- Scalable frontend built with Next.js & React for smooth user experience
- Multiple backend instances with dynamic load balancing via custom NGINX proxy
- Secure authentication with Clerk.js and data persistence via MongoDB & Prisma

  Chat messages are filtered and analyzed to block offensive or harmful content immediately.
  
- **Warning & Ban System:**  
  Users who violate abuse policies receive warnings and may be banned automatically to maintain a safe community.
