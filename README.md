# Talkify Frontend

Welcome to the **Talkify Frontend** repository â€” the user-facing React & Next.js application for Talkify, a real-time video and chat platform.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Talkify is a scalable web app that supports real-time video calls, messaging, and user authentication. The frontend is built with **Next.js 14** and connects to MongoDB via Prisma, using Socket.IO for messaging and LiveKit for video calls.

Multiple frontend instances run simultaneously to support load balancing and failover. Requests are routed dynamically via a custom NGINX reverse proxy setup.
